## 🚀 Projects

### 1. [**Email Spam Detection**](./email_spam_detection)
**Problem**: Detect phishing/spam emails using text classification.  
**Tech Stack**: Logistic Regression, TF-IDF, NLTK (text preprocessing), Joblib  
**Description**: Built a classifier to detect spam emails. Cleaned the data with stemming, removed stopwords, and used TF-IDF to transform the text data. Achieved high classification accuracy in detecting phishing emails.

### 2. [**Product Review Sentiment Analyzer**](./product_review_sentiment)
**Problem**: Classify product reviews as positive or negative.  
**Tech Stack**: Logistic Regression, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
**Description**: Analyzed product reviews and built a sentiment analysis model. The model predicts whether a product review is positive or negative using a simple classifier.

### 3. [**Book/Movie/Music Recommender**](./recommender_system)
**Problem**: Build a content-based recommendation system.  
**Tech Stack**: Cosine Similarity, TF-IDF  
**Description**: Created a simple recommender system that suggests books, movies, and music based on the content similarity using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.

### 4. [**Churn Prediction**](./churn_prediction)
**Problem**: Predict customer churn in telecom service.  
**Tech Stack**: XGBoost, Random Forest  
**Description**: Analyzed customer data to predict whether customers would leave the telecom service. Used XGBoost and Random Forest to train the model and improved model performance with hyperparameter tuning.

### 5. [**Sales Forecasting**](./sales_forecasting)
**Problem**: Forecast future sales for a retail product.  
**Tech Stack**:  Linear Regression
**Description**: Built a forecasting model to predict future sales for a retail product. Used linear regression to make predictions.

### 6. [**AI Financial Advisor Stock Piker**](./AI_Agents_for_finance)
**Problem**:stoke piking with a lot of informations .  
**Tech Stack**: OpenAI Agent SDK , CrewAI , Docker, AWS , Serpapi
**Description**: ai agents that contain 5 agents to help you chose stocks base on financial metrics.
